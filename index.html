<h1>Welcome to WISERCLUB 2019-2020 Final
</h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Preface
</h2>
<p>

This website consists of several parts: <br/> <br/>
<b>Project Description (Part 1 - Part 3)</b> <br/>This is a comprehensive data science project for the Final of WISERCLUB 2019-2020. You have got two csv files, named <i>data.csv</i> and <i>holiday.csv</i>. Try to use Python or SQL to complete the tasks with the aid of these two datasets. Please keep in mind that Data Science or Business Analytics is to use data and models to <b>find hidden information</b>. <br /> <br />
This project consists of three parts: Explorative Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing and Model Training and Prediction. The final decision about whether one will be admitted in WISERCLUB or not DOES NOT solely depend on the project. <br /> <br /> 
<b>Hints</b> <br/> There will be some hints for the project. Some problems require close analysis and observations, therefore some related hints are not shown at the beginning. The days for them to be shown on the website are marked with bold words, but please try to find answers by yourself before that time. <br /> <br />
<b>Numerical Experiments (Part 4)</b> <br/> Some numerical computing tricks in Python are listed in this part as problems. Although Part 4 is not considered as a part of Final Project, there are some interesting findings if you have time solve those problems. <br /> <br />

Now, you could begin your exploration in the ocean of data. <br /> 


</p>
<h2>Submission
</h2>
<p>

Create a <b>Github</b> Account and upload your files there. If you complete your project, just send your Github link to <a href = "mailto:liulidaily@163.com"> liulidaily@163.com </a>. <br /> <br />



<b>For Python User</b>: Jupyter Notebook is preferred,  PDF version is also OK. <br />



<b>For SQL User</b>: Answers in PDF version. <br /> 
<b>Language</b>: English is preferred, Chinese is OK. <br /><br />


<b>Submission Deadline (Temporary)</b>: March 15, 2020

<h2>Notes (Please read before proceeding)
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			For all final takers, be responsible for your work!
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			For all students <b>in WISERCLUB Undergraduate Department ONLY </b>, you are required to complete tasks from the beginning to <b>Part 2-1</b> and you are recommended to complete all tasks.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			For all students <b>in WISERCLUB Undergraduate Department ONLY </b>, you could discuss with each other as a group, but your codes should not be the same. Plagiarism will lead to <b>an automatic denial </b> for your admission. 
		</p>
	</li>
<li><p>Try not overwrite either of your files. This is very dangerous in real work. The number of times you ask for the files of the original datasets will have an impact on the final evaluation of your work. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>You could upload the reports and python/SQL codes, but DO NOT upload files with extension <i>.csv</i> for SECURITY reasons.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>You may meet with missing data, drop them if they have little impact on your data analysis work.
</p>
</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The results should be printed in your Jupyter Notebook or PDF files. But the output formats are not restricted except being mentioned in hints. Do not worry about the size of the data, for problems 
			expecting to report <tt>array</tt> or <tt>DataFrame</tt>, just use <tt>print</tt> function or use <tt>.head()</tt> method to print the first several lines.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			For SQL User, you need to first figure out how to transform the <i>csv</i> data into the database.
		</p>
	</li>
