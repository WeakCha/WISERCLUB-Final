<h2>Part 1: Explorative Data Analysis
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Find the time span of the order data.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find the number of orders each day.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><font color = "#0000FF">Boss: we need to design two different strategies for sales in workdays and sales in weekends.</font> <br /> True or False? Explain. 
</p>
</li></ol>
</li>
<li><p>Find the number of users.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find ten commodities with the highest sales. 
</p>
	<ol>
	<li> <p>(Python Users Only) Draw graphs with x-axis the commodity name and y-axis the # of orders.
		</p>
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Find the discount rate of each order and concat it onto the original dataset with column name <i>discount_rate</i>. You may use <i>pay_money</i>, <i>coffeestore_share_money</i>, <i>commodity_origin_money</i> and <i>commodity_income</i>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the average discount of each week. One week should consist of Sunday to Saturday.
	</p>
	</li>
<li>
	<p>Find <i>Retention Rate</i> of any five days. For example, if you want to compute the <i>Retention Rate</i> on 2019-02-10, then you need to find users who bought goods on 02-09 and 02-10. 
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Find the <i> Week Retention Rate </i> of any day, which means finding the users buying at that day and buying again within several days later.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Find the <i> Retention Rate WITHIN one week of new users</i>. You could choose any <i> week </i> you want, but it must consist of Sunday to Saturday. you need to find users buying the first product and buying again within that week.
		</p>
	</li>
<li><p>Find &ldquo;Active Users&rdquo; (which means the number of orders of one user is greater equal to 5).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write the table you get in 8 as a csv file with filename <i>ActiveUser.csv</i>. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide a description of the number of orders for each active user (# of ActiveUser, mean, std, variance, range, skewness, kurtosis )


</p>
	<ol>
	<li>
		<p> (For SQL User Only) Find the # of ActiveUser, mean, range.
		</p>
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 2: Data Preprocessing
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Remove the first column, because it is just a copy of index.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><font color = '#0000FF'> Boss: To implement Collaborative Filtering in recommendation systems, we need a user-item table to show the number of orders for each user and each item.</font> <br />

Try to construct <i>user-item</i> table. An example of user-item pair: (Phone_No, 标准美式)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><font color = '#0000FF'>Boss: Life is not a Markov Chain, which means everyone's past behavior is correlated with his present one. And that is why we could exploit past purchase behavior to predict their future buying trends.</font> <br />

Try to construct a dataset to show this past purchasing behavior trend. For convenience, several instructions are proposed as follows
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Two days correspond to one dimension. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last two days of the time span of the data should be the <i>future</i>, which means it corresponds to the <i>target</i> field for the following data mining models. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The length of each user vector must be maximized. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The dataset should be a <tt>DataFrame</tt> in Pandas, so you could customize the columns as you wish. <br />

For example, if the time span is from 2019-02-01 to 2019-02-10, then there are 10 days altogether. So each user corresponds to a 5-dimensional vector, with 4 features and 1 target dimension. The vector <tt>[4, 0, 0, 0, 1]</tt>  means this user bought one good between 02-09 and 02-10, and four goods between 02-01 and 02-02. Additionally, the length of each user vector MUST BE 5 because of the rule 3. 


</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 3: Model Training and Prediction
</h2>
<p>

<font color = '#0000FF'>Boss: For the target field, 1 means he purchased in the future and 0 means he did not. Then you could use traditional classification algorithms to predict the future behaviors of all users.</font>


</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Transform the data you got from the last section into an <tt>array</tt> in Numpy. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split the data into features <tt>X</tt> and targets <tt>Y</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <i>Adaboost</i>, <i>Random Forest</i> in Sklearn to construct the model for prediction with 3-fold cross validation. 
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(Optional) Use <i>Xgboost</i>. 
</p>
</li>
	<li><p><font color = '#0000FF'>Boss: We could, but we do not use <i>Naive Bayes</i> or <i>Support Vector Machine</i> in this project. </font> <br />
True of False? Explain.
</p>
</li></ol>
</li>
<li><p>Tune your model and report the best metrics you could get for your model and the corresponding confusion matrix and model name. At least <i>Adaboost </i> and <i> Random Forest</i> should be used for tuning. <br /> Here are some suggestions.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Try to do oversampling or undersampling. This is an imbalanced classification problem.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the parameters of each model (e.g. scale_pos_weight in <i>Xgboost</i> and probability threshold), more information could be found in the Official Documentations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accuracy is not suitable to be an evaluation metric in this case. Use F1-measure. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to not record the # of orders for each user. Record whether he bought the goods instead, 1 if he bought and 0 otherwise.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to record the <i>active-user</i> feature. Many users did not only buy one cup of drink during two days, so whether one user is active should be taken into consideration. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>
	Try to split the data with respect to Workdays and Weekends and train two different models. If that is the best choice, then you should report <b>two</b> metrics, one for Workdays Model and the other one for Weekends Model.
	</p>
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li><p>After tuning, try to explain why your model works better.  
</p>
</li>
