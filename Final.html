<h1>Welcome to WISERCLUB 2019-2020 Final</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
You have got two csv files, named <i>data.csv</i> and <i>holiday.csv</i>. Try to use Python or SQL to complete the tasks with the aid of these two datasets. Please keep in mind that Data Science or Business Analytics is to use data and models to <b>find hidden information</b>. <br /> <br />

There will be some hints for each small task, most of them are listed here, but a few of them are not shown. This is because the corresponding problems require close analysis and observation. The days for them to be shown on the website are marked with bold words, but please try to find answers by yourself before that time. <br /> <br />

This project consists of three parts: Explorative Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing and Model Training and Prediction. Regarding that most of the students have not learned data mining courses in this semester, completing one or two parts of the project is acceptable (although three is preferred). The final decision about whether one will be admitted in WISERCLUB or not DOES NOT solely depend on the project. In summary, be responsible for your work. <br /> <br /> 

Now, you could begin your exploration in the ocean of data. <br /> 
</p>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>
Create a <b>Github</b> Account and upload your answers file there. If you complete your project, just send me the link. <br /> <br />

<b>For Python User</b>: Jupyter Notebook is preferred,  PDF version is also OK. <br />

<b>For SQL User</b>: Answers in PDF version. <br /> <br />

<b>Submission Deadline</b>: March 15, 2020
</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do not overwrite either of your files. The number of times you ask for the files of the original datasets will have an impact on the final evaluation of your work. </p>
</li>
<li><p>You could upload the reports and python/SQL codes, but DO NOT upload files with extension <i>.csv</i> for SECURITY reasons.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You may meet with missing data, drop them if they have little impact on your data analysis work.</p>
</li>
